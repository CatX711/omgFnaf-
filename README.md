## the goofy description:

a funny little game made by me in my spare time.

## story:

you're jeffery donald: a lazy, incompotent teen trying to make a quick buck by working at the local
pizza place. unbenownced to you, there's someone after you. 
after you get multiple warnings from your co-worker, you are left alone and everyone goes home.
apparently life really hates you because you wake up in the middle of the night, locked in the building.
a phone rings, and some nerdy sounding kid tells you that he hacked the animatronics and they can kill you now.
*ahhh oh nooooooo* is what's going through your tiny brain. dont't fret, you have a flashlight which can be
used to scare away the animatronics at your doors.
survive until 6 am!

### note:

*there are 6 indivudual hours, where the gameplay will take place.*
*after each hour, you will get to explore new areas of the map, with new enemies. you even get to recharge your flashlight!*

*this game is essentially in it's baby stages. expect a lotta' bugs that have not been ironed out yet. enjoy!*
